This is a cpp program implemented by the CERN analysis framework ROOT.

Ranwalk.ccp = 1000 points doing random walks across 1/2/3 dimensional space.

Randwalkfriends.ccp = 1000 iteration of the problem of two friend far D from each other walking following a random walk. It will be plotted the time taken to meet each other of any iteration.
